# GLAB 330.2.1 – Correlation Coefficient and Covariance

## Objective
This project demonstrates how to calculate and interpret covariance and correlation coefficient using a simple dataset of temperature and ice cream sales.

## Dataset
Three days of data:
- Temperature (X)
- Ice Cream Sales (Y)

## Steps Performed
1. Calculated the mean of X and Y
2. Computed deviations
3. Calculated covariance
4. Calculated standard deviations
5. Computed correlation coefficient
6. Created visualization

## Result
The correlation coefficient was approximately +1, showing a very strong positive relationship between temperature and ice cream sales.
